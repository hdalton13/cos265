                    **P04_PathFinding**


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Assignment Details
===================


`Pathfinding` Implementation
---------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Pathfinding data type.
What did you work on first?
What did you work on next?
-->
In the implementation of Pathfinder, the goal was to set the best path to take from
point 'a' to point 'b'. For our implementation we created a board of PFNodes inorder
to keep track of the paths cost and other functions. Another thing that we did was
in commutePath was to make sure that as long as lastOnQ was not null we would push it
onto the winning path. My group first worked on the easy functions like getPathStart,
setPathEnd, etc. because they were pretty straight forward and easy to understand/
implement. Next we went step by step trying to figure out the things needed to be
added to get the implementation to run correctly. We broke it up by function, trying
to get that specific thing to work before moving forward to the next major function.

`PFNode` Implementation
------------------------

<!--
Briefly explain how you represented the search node PFNode.
-->
In my group we implemented a stack of PFNodes. This would keep track of our winning
path. Each PFNode comes with three different global variables. It has a currentLoc
which tells you where you are. It has a previousLoc which tells you where you have
been. Finally it has a cost that illustrates the cost of going to that specific
location. These three things are all called when a user calls the constructor of a
PFNode. The main function that we added to this was a setCost. This is a setter
function and would set the cost equation to 'cost' otherwise if it was the first
one the cost equaled zero.


`Walker` Implementation
------------------------

<!--
Explain briefly how you implemented the Walker data type.
-->
The main idea for the walker function is to step through each coordinate on the winning path until
reaching the end. We did this by writing a for loop that iterates through each coordinate on the
winning path. For the advanced function we calculated the amount of time that it took to get from
one coordinate to another and while that is greater than the time it needs to move forward it steps
through the amount of coordinates while simultaneously subtracting the cumulative time by the time
to move forward.



Analysis
===========


Correctness
------------

<!--
How did you test the correctness of your algorithm?
-->
We tested our code numerous times through the debugger along with using the tester resource. Another thing that we did to test the correctness of our algorithm is by entering the different test maps to make sure that the implementation looks correct for each.


Runtime Analysis
-----------------

<!--
For each of the following maps and given the default starting and ending locations, give the estimated travel cost ($\text{cost}_0(E)$) and search size for different heuristic values ($h$).
-->

map      | h   | cost | search
---------|-----|------|--------
maze32_0 |   0 |   ($\text{252}_0(E0)$)   |       942 (91%)
maze32_0 |   1 | ($\text{252}_0(E0)$)     |  848 (82%)
maze32_0 |   2 |  ($\text{252}_0(E0)$)    |       775 (75%)
maze32_0 | 128 |  ($\text{252}_0(E0)$)    |     733 (71%)
maze32_1 |   0 |    ($\text{56}_0(E0)$)  |       917 (89%)
maze32_1 |  16 |  ($\text{56}_0(E0)$)    |  608 (59%)
usa128   |   1024  |    ($\text{1.7473t}_0(E7)$)  |  7668 (46%)
usa256   | 16    |   ($\text{1.9632}_0(E7)$)   |    41351  (63%)
usa1024  |  0.125   | ($\text{1.5224}_0(E7)$)     |      525794 (50%)

<!--
Given the information above, do you notice any patterns?
Is there a value of $h$ that seems to work best?
-->

A pattern that I notice about these run times is that the cost for each map are the same and only changes when changing the map.


Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

One bug that was troublesome was that when debugging the walker function, it wouldnâ€™t step through the map. The interactivePathFinder would miss interpret the step through as a click action and then just be in a continuous loop for the first item. From what I can tell there are no bugs or limitations remaining in my group's implementation.




Reflection
===========


<!--
Did you use any of the CT Skills?
If so, which ones did you use, and how did you use them?
If not, explain what you did when you needed help.
Or, did you not need help?

- consulting an expert
- asking good questions
- edge cases
- similar problems / fewer variables
- developing subgoals
-->

Critical Thinking Skills: My group utilized three different critical thinking skills. One was consulting an expert. We had a basic idea of what needed to be done but from what we were writing we kept having to go back and debug what we had previously written. This was an eye opener for all of us so we consulted both the TA, Daniel along with Dr Denning. Another skill we utilized we developing subgoals. Each time we work on it together we set a goal for what we need to do next inorder to feel good about our progress. Finally, we utilized the skill of edge cases as we tried to write the code for each different function.

<!--
What did you do to monitor your progress and make sure you did not spend more time than necessary on this assignment?
-->
Monitor: I would say that because of our other assignments from other classes we knew we only had a limited amount of time.

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends)  and attribute them by name.
-->

Help: The main source of help that we received was from the TA, Daniel Gibson. He helped guide us in different ways of thinking about this problem. His guidance pushed us closer to the end goal inevitably leading us to complete the project.

<!--
Since this is an individual assignment, if you worked with a partner, assert below that the work you are turning in is your own work, and that you only did "whiteboard" work as a group.
Give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
If you used the code from the lab challenge, explain what is shared between you and your lab partner.
-->

Group Roles: In our group we all took over the role of thinking about the problem along with how to translate that into code. Kayla was mostly the driver of the computer/code. Me and Luke did a bunch of whiteboarding and asking clarifying questions for our own personal understanding of what was going on. My main role was finding a time that worked best for all of us, asking slack questions, along with keeping track of the total amount of time it took to complete the project.


<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
-->

Problems: We did not really encounter any serious problems throughout this project.

<!--
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

Comments: I am so thankful that this was a group project because more brains are better than one and because classes are trying to cram everything in before we go to home for thanksgiving.
