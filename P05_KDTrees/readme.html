General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


!!! note: Math Typesetting
    Surround your math with double dollar signs to have [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) typeset it beautifully.
    To add a tilde in math mode (using dollar signs), use the `\sim` command.
    If an exponent has more than one character, you must surround it with curly braces.
    In the example below, the exponent for $T$ must use curly braces, but they aren't required for $N$.

    $$ \sim T^{1.2} N^2 $$

    Note: Typesetting like this is optional; feel free to use plain text if you'd like.


Submission
-----------

Use the CSE LogHistory Plug-in to create a zip file containing all your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).
If you create a zip by other means, it will include all the files under `tests` and might miss some important files (ex: `.log/history.log`).
The former will make for a very large zip file; the latter will cause you to lose points.

Implementations
===================

kd-Tree Node
--------------

Our implementation of the kd-tree node was quite simple. Every node would hold a copy of a Point. This would allow us an
easy way to get the x and y coordinates of the node. The node would also keep track of a value. This would allow us access
to the value that is held at that particular x,y coordinate. Next we kept track of the left node and the right node
because this allowed us to look at the next nodes left and right of the current. Finally we kept track of the partition
of each node to see if it was an UPDOWN separation or a LEFTRIGHT separation.

Nearest Neighbor
------------------

In our nearest function four main events happen. First, we check to see if the point passed in is equal to null. If it is
a NullPointerException is thrown. Secondly, we check to see if the function isEmpty, then we return a null. Next we set
the nearest node to be root and the nearestDist to equal the distance of the nearestNode's point distance. Finally we
check to see if the nearestNode's point x is greater than the parameter p's x. If it is we recursively call our nearestR
function first looking at nearestNode's left point and then looking at the nearestNode's right point. Otherwise we look
at the opposite, first the nearestNode's right point and then the nearestNode's left point.

Our helper function nearestR is where the nearest node is set and recursively looked for. It goes through a bunch of
checks always looking at the left node first. If the function passes all of the recursive cases then the nearestDist is
set to the current distance and the nearestNode is changed to be what is current.


Analysis
===============


Memory
-------

<!--
Using the 64-bit memory cost model from the textbook and lecture, give the total memory usage in bytes of your 2d tree
data structure as a function of the number of points $N$.
Use tilde notation to simplify your answer (i.e., keep the leading coefficient and discard lower-order terms).
Include the memory for all referenced objects (including `Node` and `Point` objects) except for `Value` objects
(because the type is unknown and the object is owned by the client).
Also, include the memory for all referenced objects, including any references to the `Direction` enum.
-->

instance of                | bytes
---------------------------|---------
`Point`                    | $32$
`PSKDTree` with $N$ points | $\sim 328N$



Runtime
--------

<!--
How many nearest neighbor calculations can your brute-force implementation perform per second for `input100K.txt` (100,000 points) and `input1M.txt` (1 million points), where the query points are random points in the unit square?
Explain how you determined the operations per second.
(Do not count the time to read in the points from file or to build the data structure.)

Repeat the questions above with the 2d tree implementation.
--->

file            | brute force | 2d tree
----------------|-------------|---------
`input100K.txt` |         $420$ |     $708$
`input1M.txt`   |         $13$ |     $30$




Known bugs / limitations
-------------------------

<!--
What bugs or limitations were troublesome?
What bugs or limitations still remain?
Are these bugs or limitations a problem in your implementation, algorithm, or something else?
How do you know that you did not miss a bug?
What additional tests did you run to ensure that your implementations are correct?
-->

We currently have two bugs still left in our implementation of PSKD tree. According to the tester, we are having a
runtime problem for a PSKD single item. We are unsure of where we went wrong and it was difficult trying to ask a
question to specifically correct that error. Another problem found by the tester was in the nearest(k). The error
that was presented was that the tested code did something incorrectly. Logistically my group and I could not see
where we went wrong and just left it with this error.




Reflection
===========

<!--
Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
Don't include readings, lectures, but do include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs, classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
How did you discuss the problem with others? (ex: white-board algorithms, looking over code for bugs, looking at print out results, etc.)
-->

We received help from two people, Dr. Denning and the TA: Daniel Gibson. Both mainly help up with mapping out our ideas
on a whiteboard along with the debugging process. Their help was beneficial because it allowed us to understand the
problem and finish the implementation in a reasonable amount of time.



<!--
Since this is a small group assignment, give one sentence explaining what each of you contributed.
-->

We all contributed to the project by whiteboard out ideas and asking questions to help our own understanding of what was going on.



<!--
Describe any serious problems you encountered.
How much time did you spend writing new code, debugging code, thinking about the algorithms, discussing with someone else, running tests, writing comments and documentation, etc.?
List any other comments here.
Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.
-->

A main problem that we encountered was trying to ask the right questions over slack because both the people we received
help from were quarantined. Aside from this we didnâ€™t really encounter any serious problems.

writing new code: 3 hr
debugging code: 2 hr
thinking about the algorithms: 1 hr
discussing with someone else: 1.5 hr
running tests: 1.5 hr
writing comments and documentation: 2 hr

Another comment that I would recommend is to have more group projects. I feel that I learn a lot more and understand
things a lot better when working in a group.
