General
=======

I have chosen three submissions for you to review.
Only the `HexBoard.java` file from the submitted zip files was copied into a fresh project folder, so no personally identifiable information remains.

Perform a code review on `HexBoard.java` for each of the sample solutions.
Spend approximately 10--20 minutes on studying each submission.

Keep in mind that these solutions are the work of your peers.
Try to remain as objective and constructive as possible, as you could be reviewing the work of one of your teammates!

If you recognize your own work, you are free to claim ownership, or you may remain silent on the ownership.
That is up to you.

For those that want to learn what other reviews found, I will post the results to the course LMS page.



Submission
----------

Submit only the `readme.html` file.
Only one person per group needs to make a submission.

Clarity: The code was somewhat clear. There were some comments in different places. The names of the variables could have
been more clear like naming num to be numUnset so you don't have to look at the declaration to see what it was. It isn't clear
what the difference between the two double arrays and the union object. If they named them "playerBoard", "unionBoard", and kept the "my_union",
it would have been more clear.

Unique: The way the user created the board with two extra rows and columns on the outside to indicate a physical virtual node.
Clever: The double array was clever because we couldn't mentally figure out how to get that to work with the union function.

Bugs: None that we could detect.

Efficiency: The board is set up with two for loops which takes the run time out of constant.

Comments: N/A

Clarity: This person needs to make the names of their variables more clear because a reviewer should not have to assume what
the single letter names should be. There are no useful comments for the viewer to understand what is going on. The checkRange
function was the only well named function, letting the viewer know exactly what its operation was.

Unique: The string array and the plus and minus character to signify the player was really unique.
Clever: RLIST and CLIST was clever in checking the six places around the set location.

Bugs: Mainly relies on math and seems to be an easy way to get an error. But otherwise there are no bugs that we could see.

Efficiency: For the most part, this person's code was efficient. They had two nested for loops at different times and one
single for loop also. Other than this, they stayed in constant time. Since there are for loops and nested for loops, the code will
be stressed with a larger board size input.

Comments: N/A

Clarity: This was the best code to look at. All the names for both variables and helper functions were clear and the reviewer
did not have to assume what any of them were meant to do. The only comment that was added was to clarify that len was the length.
Otherwise there was no need to add clarifying comments.

Unique: Counting the two different player moves and subtracting it from the size of the board.
Clever: The two different player unions was unique.

Bugs: The code creates four extra variables in the p1Uf and p2Uf that is unnecessary. We are talking about the 4 virtual nodes.
Since they create two different UF objects, there is only a need for 2 virtual nodes per object. In creating 4 per object, the creator
incidentally made 4 extra spaces in memory. Another bug is that they didn't solve the backwash problem.

Efficiency: Very efficient code! There are no loops and it stays in constant time the whole time.

Comments: N/A



Reflection
==========

-->

Common: All three coders used a double array for their boards. Two out of three need to name variables better. All uses
the union-find correctly.

Changed Mind:

    Luke: I wish I would have thought of the two different union objects, one with virtuals and one without, in order to solve the
    backwash problem. That along with keeping track of the last piece set would have solved it for me. The way Subject2 kept track of
    moves in order to return the number of unset tiles without a loop is also something I wish I thought of. My code also wasn't the best in
    terms of comments and readability.

    Heather: Seeing the different thought processes other classmate went through to solve one problem was very interesting to me.
    I learned that no-matter the problem there can be many different ways to solve it. The other thing I learned in reviewing others
    people's code is how important clearly naming variable/functions and explaining functionality using comments are.

Feedback: We both really enjoyed looking over others code because it provided a new way that neither of us thought about when
approaching this problem.
